   What is WeMail?</h3>
</p>

<p style= "font-family: Calibri"> WeMail is an email service that can be accessed using a standard web browser. It contrasts with email service accessible through a specialised email client software. Emails are delivered extremely fast when compared to traditional post. WeMail means emails can be sent and received from any computer, anywhere in the world, that has an internet connection.<br> </p>
<h3>

<p>WeMail keeps you updated with real-time message notifications, and safely stores your important emails and data. IT admins can centrally manage accounts across your organization and devices.</p>
<h3>Get custom email @yourcompany</h3><p>
